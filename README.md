Project Overview

This project is a console-based C++ application designed to simulate electrical load monitoring and electricity billing for a small household or facility.

The system allows users to register electrical appliances, calculate daily energy consumption, estimate electricity costs using a tariff per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and automatically store appliance data using file handling.

This project demonstrates the practical application of C++ programming concepts in solving real-world electrical engineering problems.

Features Implemented

Appliance Management

Register appliance (Name, Power rating in watts, Usage hours per day) View all registered appliances Search appliance by name Structured menu-driven interface Energy Calculation

Energy consumption is calculated using the formula:

Energy (kWh/day) = (Power × Hours) ÷ 1000

The system:

Computes individual appliance energy usage Computes total daily energy consumption Displays formatted energy summary tables Billing Calculation

The program:

Accepts electricity tariff per kWh Calculates daily electricity cost Estimates monthly energy and cost (30-day projection) Formulas used:

Daily Cost = Total kWh/day × Tariff Monthly Energy = Daily Energy × 30 Monthly Cost = Monthly Energy × Tariff

File Storage (fstream Implementation)

Appliance data is saved in:

appliances.txt

Data format:

Name|PowerW|HoursPerDay

Example:

Fan|75|8 TV|120|5

When the program restarts:

Data is automatically loaded Previously registered appliances are restored Ensures data persistence Input Validation

The system validates:

Appliance name must not be empty Power rating must be greater than zero Usage hours must be between 0 and 24 Tariff must be positive Invalid menu selections are handled safely How to Compile and Run

Open terminal inside the project folder and run:

g++ main.cpp -o main ./main
